There two technologies to show "a small icon with menu actions":

  - **Legacy Xorg tray icons** represent the old method, which has been retired in modern desktops. They may still
    work well in older desktops such as XFCE though.
  - **App Indicators** represent the modern method, which was initially created by Ubuntu for Unity desktop and
    adopted by modern desktops either as a built-in feature (elementaryOS) or an extension (GNOME).

App Indicators in GNOME {: #gnome}
=======================

{$ 4/desktops/learn_gnome.md $}

There is a difference between the original GNOME and tweaked GNOME in Ubuntu.

  - **The vanilla/unmodified GNOME** (as shipped in Fedora, Arch Linux, etc.) does not support app indicators out of the box but
    there is [AppIndicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/615/appindicator-support/) for that.
  - **The Ubuntu's GNOME** includes a similar extension pre-installed, so app indicators are supported right away.
