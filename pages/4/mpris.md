MPRIS Applets in GNOME {: #gnome}
======================

{$ 4/desktops/learn_gnome.md $}

Built-in Applet {: #gnome-builtin}
---------------

The built-in media player applet can be found among notifications under the date & time button.

1. Click Date & Time button.
2. The applet shows **track metadata** (album art, track title, and artist).
3. You can **control media playback** (skip to the previous track, toggle play/pause, skip to the next track).
4. You can click the notification itself to **show Nuvola window**.

Media Player Indicator Extension {: #gnome-extension}
--------------------------------

Although the built-in media player applet is good enough, I recommend checking out the awesome
[Media Player Indicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/)
(originally created by Jean-Philippe Braun, now developed by Jason Gray). 

1. Install [Media Player Indicator extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/).
2. Reload the web page.
3. Click Preferences icon.
4. Tune the extension according to your liking.

The extension provides more features than the built-in applet:

1. The extension shows **track metadata** (album art, track title, artist and album).
2. You can **control media playback** (skip to the previous track, toggle play/pause, skip to the next track).
3. You can click the notification itself to **show Nuvola window**.
4. You can **adjust the volume** of audio playback (if the particular supports that).
5. You can **jump to a different position** within the track (if the particular supports that).
6. You can **see and change rating** (if the particular script supports that).
