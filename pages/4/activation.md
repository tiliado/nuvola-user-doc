Title: Nuvola 4 Activation
Path: /4/activation/

Nuvola Player is activated by entering a license key. There are three kinds of license keys:

  * **License keys from Gumroad**:
    If you purchased Nuvola on Gumroad, you should receive two emails within a few minutes after your purchase
    but they might sometimes be delayed.

    1. An email from Nuvola team "How to activate Nuvola application".
    2. An email from Gumroad containing a receipt and **a license key**.

    If you cannot see any email with the license key, please check your spam folder as well.
    Alternatively, the key should be available also in your [your Gumroad Library](https://gumroad.com/library)
    as specified in the [Where is my purchase?](https://help.gumroad.com/article/9-where-is-my-purchase)
    page from Gumroad Help center.
    If you still cannot find the license key, [contact Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).

  * **License keys for migrated Tiliado accounts**: If you purchased Nuvola **before September 3rd, 2018**, 
    you haven't received any license key from Gumroad but your purchase was linked to your Tiliado account.
    However, Tiliado account have also been migrated to custom license keys.
    If you haven't received any key, [contact Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).

  * **Developer license keys**: These keys are granted free of charge for help with Nuvola development.
    If you feel you contributed to the project significantly, you can [contact Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).


**Once you obtain the license key, you can activate Nuvola.**

  1. Update Nuvola flatpaks to the latest version. You can use GNOME/Ubuntu Software Center (3.22 or later) with
     the Flatpak plugin or you can use these two commands:

         flatpak update --user
         flatpak update --system

  2. Install and launch any Nuvola app from the list [Available Nuvola Apps](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/index/),
     then open Preferences dialog of that app. The screenshot shows *"Nuvola Player â€¢ Nuvola Apps Runtime"* as a generic
     placeholder, real apps don't show *"Nuvola Player"* but *"Deezer"*, *"Spotify"*, *"Google Play Music"*, etc.
     instead.
  
  3. Look for the Features Tier label in the middle of the dialog and click "Unlock features" or "Info" buttons.
  
  4. If there are any previous purchases, remove them with the *rubbish bin* button.
  
  5. Click I purchased Nuvola Runtime.
  
  6. Enter the license key and click *Continue*.
  
  7. If the key is valid, the details of your license are shown.
  
  8. If there are any issues, contact [Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).
