Title: Nuvola 4 Activation
Path: /4/activation/

There are two ways to activate Nuvola.

  * **License key from Gumroad**: Use this method if you purchased Nuvola on **Gumroad after September 2nd, 2018**.
    You should have immediately received a license key in that case.
  * **Tiliado account**: Use this method if you purchased Nuvola via **PayPal**, **Patreon**, or **Gumroad**
   (before September 3rd, 2018). In that case, you haven't received any license key but your purchase was
   linked to your Tiliado account.
