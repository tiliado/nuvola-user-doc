Title: Tailor-Made for Linux Desktop
Path: /4/desktops/

For us, Linux is not a secondary platform but the system we love and use every day.
The mission of the project is to provide the best integration with Linux desktops.

Selected Desktop Environments
=============================

Although Nuvola should work in all Linux desktop environments, we currently test only
[GNOME](:4/desktops/gnome.html) (Ubuntu, Fedora),
[Cinnamon](:4/desktops/cinnamon.html) (Linux Mint),
[Unity](:4/desktops/unity.html) (Ubuntu),
and [Pantheon](:4/desktops/pantheon.html) (elementaryOS).
We hope to explore other desktops in the future.
