!!! warning "Google Chrome eats multimedia keys"
    It has been reported that **Google Chrome 73 or later exclusively binds media keys**,
    which makes them unavailable for other applications including Nuvola.

    If you are affected by this issue, open a new Chrome tab, enter address
    `chrome://flags/#hardware-media-key-handling` and disable **Hardware Media Key Handling**.

To enable *Multimedia keys*, open Preferences dialog from the Menu button and
