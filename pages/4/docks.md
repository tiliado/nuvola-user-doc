Unity Dock {: #unity}
==========

{$ 4/desktops/learn_unity.md $}

Unity Dock (also known as Unity Launcher) shows running and pinned applications. If Extra Dock Actions are enabled,
Nuvola adds extra menu items to the launcher menu, e.g. playback controls or rating.

**Tip:** You can [pin your favorite Nuvola app to the launcher](:4/desktop_launchers.html#unity-dock) for faster access.
If the app is pinned and [running in the background](:4/background_playback.html), you can then control it with dock
menu actions.
