Title: Thank You For Purchasing Nuvola
Path: /4/thankyou/

We appreciate your support. It helps us to cover the project's expenses and motivates us to focus on quality and to
develop Nuvola further even though some obstacles may seem too demanding. By purchasing Nuvola, you told us:
*"Don't give up, we appreciate your work."*

**You should have received a licence key from Gumroad by now.**

  * The key was sent to your email address registered at Gumroad. If you cannot see any email from Gumroad, please look
    into the spam folder as well.
  * You can also get the key from your [your Gumroad Library](https://gumroad.com/library).
  * You can consult the [Where is my purchase?](https://help.gumroad.com/11167-buyer-faq/where-is-my-purchase)
    page from Gumroad Help center.
  * If you still cannot find it, please [contact Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).


**You can now use the license key to activate Nuvola.**

  1. Update Nuvola flatpaks to the latest version. You can use GNOME/Ubuntu Software Center (3.22 or later) with
     the Flatpak plugin or you can use these two commands:

         flatpak update --user
         flatpak update --system

  2. Install and launch any Nuvola app from the list [Available Nuvola Apps](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/index/),
     then open Preferences dialog of that app. The screenshot shows *"Nuvola Player â€¢ Nuvola Apps Runtime"* as a generic
     placeholder, real apps don't show *"Nuvola Player"* but *"Deezer"*, *"Spotify"*, *"Google Play Music"*, etc.
     instead.
  
  3. Look for the Features Tier label in the middle of the dialog and click "Unlock features" or "Info" buttons.
  
  4. If there are any previous purchases, remove them with the *rubbish bin* button.
  
  5. Click I purchased Nuvola Runtime.
  
  6. Select *I have purchased Nuvola Runtime and received a license key* and click *Continue*.
  
  7. Enter the license key and click *Continue*.
  
  8. If the key is valid, the details of your license are shown.
  
  9. If there are any issues, contact [Tiliado support](mailto:support@tiliado.eu).
