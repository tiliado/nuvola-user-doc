Title: Nuvola Runtime Service

{$ 4/features/nuvola_service.md $}


Nuvola Apps Service provides:

  * Global configuration storage: It is used to store your license so that
    each app doesn't need to ask for it again and again.
  * [Global keyboard shortcuts](:4/keyboard_shortcuts.html): All apps share
    a single global keybinder to reduce the risk of conflicting keybindings.
  * [Remote Control over HTTP](:4/http_control.html): All apps share a single
    HTTP server so that you need to listen on a single host & port configuration.
  * [Command-line controller](:4/command_line.html).
