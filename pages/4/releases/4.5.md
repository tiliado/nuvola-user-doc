# New Features

  * Nuvola Apps Runtime supports **the integration of a progress bar and volume management**. Web app scripts
    which use this feature can not only provide track length & position and current volume but also allow
    a user to change that remotely, e.g. from
    [Media Player GNOME Shell extension](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/55/media-player-indicator/).
    At present, only Deezer
    and Google Play Music scripts use these features, but others will follow.
    Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#22](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/22) Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#155](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/155)
  * If Nuvola Apps Runtime detects **a Nvidia graphics card**, it checks whether the flatpak extension with 
    corresponding graphics driver is installed. If it isn't, e.g. because of a bug in GNOME Software,
    an error message is shown to provide the user with installation instructions. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#342](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/342)
  * After a lot of effort, a workaround for **the instability of Flash plugin** was found out and is used until
    WebKitGTK developers find a proper fix. However, it is applied only in flatpak builds because it may have
    a negative impact on other WebKitGTK applications otherwise. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#354](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/354)

# Bug fixes

  * A wrong command in desktop launcher was fixed. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#348](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/348)

# Under the Hood

  * **New dependencies:** libdrm >= 2.2 and libdri2 >= 1.0
  * Nuvola checks whether VDPAU and VA-API drivers are installed and prints debugging information to console.
    **It will show error dialog in the future though, so make sure the drivers are installed.**
