Title: Nuvola 4.7

Nuvola 4.7 was released on September 1st, 2017.

Note that Nuvola versioning has changed after Nuvola 3.1.3 and version 3.1.x became 4.x (3 + 1 = 4).

# New Features

  * New web app:  Jupiter Broadcasting by Andrew Stubbs.
  * The genuine flatpak builds offers free trial and $1/month subscription.

    [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#359](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/359)
  * URL sandbox was not honoured properly: Issue:
    [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#367](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/367)

# News for Script Maintainers:

  * API 4.6 is required for new scripts.

# Under the Hood:

  * Nuvola no longer bundles `*.vapi` files but depends on those of Valac 0.36.3. However, glib-2.0.vapi and
    webkit2gtk-web-extension-4.0.vapi must be patched to work properly (see `vapi/*.patch`). You may need to modify
    wscript if you don't use Valac 0.36. Issue:
    [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#369](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/369)
  * Valac and GLib dependencies were raised to 0.36.3 and 2.52. Issue:
    [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#369](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/369)
  * GIR XML and typelib files are generated. Introduces new dependency on g-ir-compiler.
  * There was a lot of refactoring to allow usage of Python-GObject and to support multiple web engines in future.
  * Future warning: Nuvola is likely to introduce dependency on Python 3.6.

# Nuvola SDK 4.7.0

  * desktop launcher: Spaces around the equals sign were removed because they confuse kbuildsycoca5. Issue:
    [tiliado/nuvolaruntime#365](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/365)
    [Upstream ticket](https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=310674)
  * Added individual version info properties - `nuvolasdk.VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR/MICRO`.
  * new-project: New `metadata.in.json` files use the latest Nuvola SDK version.

# Diorite 4.7.0

  * Diorite no longer bundles *.vapi files and depends on those of Vala 0.36.3.
  * GLib dependency has been raised to 2.52.0 to make use of Valac's GTask support.
  * Diorite GTK namespace was changed to Drtgtk.
  * GIR XML and typelib files are generated. Introduces new dependency on g-ir-compiler.
