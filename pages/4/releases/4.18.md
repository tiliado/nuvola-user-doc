### What’s New for Users

* **New scripts:** Apple Music and Gaana.

* **Qobuz script** adopted by a new maintainer Romain Berger adjusted to the new design.

* **Pocket Casts script 1.4:** Fix integration of play/pause buttons and volume management
  [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/659)].

* **Google Play Music is shutting down.** The integration script in Nuvola is deprecated and will be eventually
  removed. [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/660)]

* **Users with Tilado account migrated to license keys.** If you use a Tiliado account to activate Nuvola and haven’t
  received the e-mail with a license key, please get in touch.
  [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/556)].

* **Widevine plugin is mandatory** to ensure it is available in case a streaming service needs it for better audio
  quality. [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/647)].

* **Nuvola now persists session cookies**, which prevents Jamendo from forgetting an already logged-in user
  [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/567)].

### Under the hood

* **Flatpak manifest refactoring.** Flatpak manifests are recipes used to build Flatpak packages and are now publicly
  available at [the tiliado/nuvola-flatpaks repository on GitHub](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-flatpaks).
  We also upgraded GNOME SDK to the latest version 3.38
  [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/641)].

*  Flatpak manifests are checked with our new flatpak-manifest-update tool each day to keep our dependencies
   up-to-date. [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-flatpaks/issues/2)]

* **Compiler warnings are history.** Nuvola now builds without compiler warnings except for a few deprecations
  [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/483)].

* **Reorganization of git branches.** Nuvola and Diorite used to have the *master* branch for releases and *devel*
  branch for development, but the stable release branch is now called *release-4.x* and branch *master* is used for
  development. [[GitHub Ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/648)]
