Title: Nuvola 4.15

Nuvola 4.15 was released on December 28th, 2018.

This is a concise changelog. Refer to [Nuvola News Announcement](https://medium.com/nuvola-news/nuvola-4-15-released-ccf2e02e6d4e) for a more verbose one and to see some screenshots.

### What’s New for Users

 * New streaming service: Jamendo (maintained by Jiří Janoušek).

 * Nuvola team now officially supports OpenSUSE Leap 15.0 and Tumbleweed.

 * Client-side decorations are now default. During testing Nuvola with *KDE Plasma* desktop environment, I noticed
   thick white borders around the Nuvola main window, which are quite ugly
   [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/486)]. Client-side window decorations don’t suffer
   from this theming inconsistency issues and are now used by default for that reason. However, you can still change
   window decorations or theme in Appearance preferences.

 * NPR One release 1.2: The filter of external addresses, which are opened in the user’s default web browser,
   was adjusted to allow NPR One login pages inside Nuvola
   [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/481)]. Thanks to *Evan D* for reporting the issue.

  * A broken detection of the presence of **Nvidia GL drivers** was fixed
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/480)]. Thanks to *Artem Hluvchynskyi* for
    reporting this issue.

  * **A memory corruption**, which was silent unless special run-time memory checks of GNU C library were enabled, was
    fixed [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/488)]. Thanks to *Frederic Crozat* for
    reporting the issue. The memory checks are now enabled during the development of Nuvola to avoid similar bugs in
    future [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/490)].

  * The filter of external addresses was adjusted to allow *Google Sign-In* pages used by *Jamendo*.

  * Various **memory leaks** and invalid memory access issues were fixed in an ongoing effort to improve the quality
    of Nuvola & Diorite codebase. More details are provided in the *Under the hood section* below.

### What’s New for Script Maintainers

  * Nuvola SDK commands `new-project`and `convert-project`new-project, update modification time of files with zero
    modification time, which were typically copied from within
    [Nuvola ADK](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/wiki/Nuvola-App-Developer-Kit)
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/issues/10)]. They might pose problems to some software, e.g.
    [Unison file synchronizer](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/).

  * Nuvola SDK command `check-project` detects files with zero modification times.

### What’s New for Packagers

  * New release: **NPR One 1.2** [[Source code](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-app-npr-one)]: The filter of external
    addresses was adjusted to allow NPR One login pages.
