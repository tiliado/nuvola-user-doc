Title: Nuvola 4.14

Nuvola 4.14 was released on November 11th, 2018.

This is a concise changelog. Refer to [Nuvola News Announcement](https://medium.com/nuvola-news/nuvola-4-14-released-533f1677ab5b) for a more verbose one and to see some screenshots.

### What’s New for Users

  * **New Scripts:** Tidal and MentorFM (both maintained by Jiří Janoušek).
  * **Updated Installation Instructions:** Removed: Ubuntu 16.10 Yakkety Yak, Fedora 25 and 26.
    Added: [Ubuntu 18.10 Cosmic Cuttlefish](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/nuvola/ubuntu/cosmic/)
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola.tiliado.eu/issues/13)],
    [elementaryOS 5 Juno](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/nuvola/elementary/juno/)
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola.tiliado.eu/issues/14)],
    and [Fedora 29](https://nuvola.tiliado.eu/nuvola/fedora/fc29/)
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola.tiliado.eu/issues/15)].
  * **Upgraded Library Stack:** Nuvola now uses GNOME Platform 3.30 instead of 3.28. This is a significant change
    because [the base of this runtime](https://blogs.gnome.org/alexl/2018/08/10/the-birth-of-a-new-runtime/) and
    [the way it is built have changed completely](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2018-September/msg00013.html).
    Chromium engine was updated from 68.0.3440.75 to 70.0.3538.77 bringing the latest bug fixes and enhancements
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/477)]. It is now built with Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
    toolchain instead of Ubuntu 16.04 LTS.

Other changes

  * Application entries of individual Nuvola apps in GNOME software and other software centers using AppStream metadata
    now contain their own screenshot. Previously, the screenshot of Deezer was used for all apps which might have been
    confusing. [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/issues/5)]

  * The Start-up dialog was tweaked to achieve more straightforward flow. For example, if you have just upgraded,
    Nuvola shows an info bar “You have upgraded to Nuvola X.Y.Z.” with a link “What’s New?” and a “Continue” button.
    Previously, users needed to click the close button of the window to continue, which might not have been clear.

  * Nuvola now links to [Tiliado Privacy Policy](https://tiliado.eu/privacy/). The short version is: We collect only
    the data we need to provide you with our services. We don’t sell your personal information. If you have any
    questions, feedback or a data removal request, don’t hesitate to contact support:
    [support@tiliado.eu](mailto:support@tiliado.eu)

### What’s New for Script Maintainers

  * Nuvola [CDK](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/wiki/Nuvola-Core-Developer-Kit) and
    [ADK](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/wiki/Nuvola-App-Developer-Kit) no longer ship LxTerminal.
    It depends on GTK+ 2 which isn’t included in GNOME Platform 3.30.
  * **Chromium** engine was updated from 68.0.3440.75 to 70.0.3538.77.
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/477)]
  * **Nuvola ADK**: The [Standard JavaScript style checker](https://standardjs.com/) was upgraded from 10.0.3 to
    **12.0.1**, which introduced a few new rules and made some of the already present rules more strict. Please
    [consult the changelog](https://github.com/standard/standard/blob/b8741d066c95a280d41f2a1e4649a491fcaf0d8c/CHANGELOG.md)
    to find out whether you need to fix your scripts. Don’t forget that you can run `standard --fix` to fix some style
    violations automatically. [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/479)]
  * The URL `https://www.facebook.com/login*` pattern was white-listed in the filter of external addresses.
    It is used by MentorFM, for example.

### What’s New for Third-Party Packagers

  * Various incompatibility issues with Python 3.7 were fixed
    [[GitHub ticket 1](https://github.com/tiliado/diorite/issues/26),
    [GitHub ticket 2](https://github.com/tiliado/diorite/issues/27)].
  * Nuvola is now tested with GNOME Platform 3.30
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/469)] and
    [Chromium Embedded Framework branch 3538](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src/3538/)
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/477)].
  * [Continuous Integration](https://circleci.com/gh/tiliado) is now run with Fedora 29.
  * New scripts: [MentorFM](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-app-mentorfm)
    and [Tidal](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-app-tidal).
  * Diorite: Configure script `configure` was removed. Use `waf --configure` instead.

### Under the Hood

Nuvola codebase is quite old and it bugs me that it doesn’t reflect all my knowledge and experience I have gained over
the past few years. Now, I have finally enough time to change that, so Diorite library, the utility and widget library
for Nuvola Runtime, undergoes a significant refactoring.

[Continuous Integration](https://circleci.com/gh/tiliado) of Diorite and Nuvola was improved: The code style of Diorite
and Nuvola is checked with [Vala Linter](https://github.com/tiliado/valalint) (Vala code)
and [StandardJS linter](https://standardjs.com/) (JavaScript code).
