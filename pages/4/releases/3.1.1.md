Title: Nuvola 3.1.1


The milestone 3.1.1 was released on October 2016.

New Features
============

[Ability to both display and set track rating in Media Player Indicator GNOME Shell extension](:4/explore.html#media-player-indicator-extension)
:   Providing a streaming service supports it, Nuvola Player 4 exports track rating in MPRIS
    interface and a custom method to set rating of a track. Note that as of October 30th 2016,
    [Player Indicator git master version](:4/explore.html#media-player-indicator-extension) is required.

[HTTP Remote Control interface](:4/explore.html#remote-control-over-http)
:   This interface allows creation of client apps to control Nuvola Player over network via an Engine.io socket.

[Media Player Controller web page](:4/explore.html#media-player-controller-web-page)
:   This page is an example of a client using the HTTP Remote Control interface. It allows you to control Nuvola Player
    from any device with a web browser (e.g. a phone).
[Nuvola Controller Pebble Watchapp](:4/explore.html#nuvola-controller-pebble-watchapp)
:   This app for Pebble watches is another example of a client using the HTTP Remote Control interface. It allows you to control Nuvola Player
    from your wrist.
[Password Manager](:4/explore.html#password-manager)
:  With the Password Manager, you can store passwords from login forms in a secure keyring.

Enhancements
============

  * An option to always run in background regardless a song is playing or not. See in action in
    [Unity](./explore.html#play-in-background-with-notifications) or
    [GNOME](./explore.html#play-in-background-with-notifications_1).
  * Better support of HTML5 Audio. It is sufficient for ownCloud Music web app but more work is still necessary to support Google Play Music. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#52](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/52)
  * Pop-up windows are allowed to pop up a new window, which is required by the SoundCloud's log-in-via-Google feature. Issue: [tiliado/nuvola-app-soundcloud#3](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvola-app-soundcloud/issues/3)
  * A hint how to edit or remove a keyboard shortcut. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#217](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/217)
  * Users can disable media keys bindings in the Preferences dialog. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#237](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/237)
  * Inter process communication backed has been rewritten.
  * All web app scripts have been ported to comply with the latest guidelines.
  * Packaging improvements: support of independent installation of individual scripts and correct package metadata (e.g. license and homepage).

  * Warnings when Notifications is being disabled has been removed. Issue: [tiliado/nuvolaplayer#227](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaplayer/issues/227)
