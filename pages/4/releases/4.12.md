# What’s New for Script Maintainers

  * Commands `nuvolasdk new-project`, `nuvolasdk convert-project` and `nuvolasdk check-project` were updated to follow
    the latest Nuvola standards: two space indentations and no trailing whitespace are used for `metadata.in.json` and
    [Standard JS code style](https://wiki.gnome.org/Design/Whiteboards/AppMenuMigration) is enforced for `integrate.js`.
  * The `README.md`template was updated and the command `nuvolasdk convert-project`creates `template--README.md` &
    `template--README.md.diff` files to help with the update of your `README.md`file.
  * Nuvola SDK build system: If `src/webview.png` image is found, it is used to generate screenshots combining that web
    view snapshot image with [base Nuvola screenshots](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/tree/master/nuvolasdk/data/screenshots).
    The resulting images can be found in the screenshots subdirectory. More screenshot types will be added in the next
    development cycle. [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/issues/5)]
  * Changes in [guidelines](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/guidelines.html):
    [Web view snapshots](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/screenshots.html) are mandatory,
    [Standard JS coding style](https://standardjs.com/) for `integrate.json` is mandatory,
    the minimal API level was raised to 4.11.
  * [Nuvola.Core::NavigationRequest](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/api_reference.html#Nuvola.Core::NavigationRequest):
    You can overwrite `request.url` field to force redirect during
    [URL filtering](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/url-filtering.html).
  * [Nuvola.queryAttribute](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/api_reference.html#Nuvola.queryAttribute):
    You can specify a parent element and a relative selector as an array of [parent element, selector].
  * [Nuvola.queryText](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/api_reference.html#Nuvola.queryText):
    You can specify a parent element and a relative selector as an array of [parent element, selector].
  * [Nuvola.setInputValueWithEvent](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/api_reference.html#Nuvola.setInputValueWithEvent):
    The change event is emitted as well.
  * Nuvola ADK is no longer built with the WebKitGTK+ backend.
  * The default web app requirements `Feature[Flash] Codec[MP3]`were dropped.
  * An issue with radio actions in developer sidebar toggling themselves without user interaction was fixed.
    [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/440)]
  * [Service Integrations Tutorial](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/tutorial.html) and
    [Media Player Integration](https://tiliado.github.io/nuvolaplayer/development/apps/mediaplayer.html) pages were
    updated to use [a new demo player](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/nuvola-player-devel/xGOeh7hN0VE/xdIbhnHiAwAJ). 

# What’s New for Third-Party Packagers

  * A **build error** with`--no-cef` flag was fixed and a **continuous integration** task was set up to test a build
    configuration with this flag after each commit. [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolaruntime/issues/435)]
  * Since the genuine flatpak builds of Nuvola no longer use WebKitGTK+ backend, **all scripts are tested only with
    the Chromium backend** and specify `Chromium[X.Y.Z]` requirement for that reason. If you are stuck with
    the WebKitGTK backend, you may remove `Chromium[X.Y.Z] Feature[MSE]` requirements to make the script run with
    the WebKitGTK+ backend and add `Feature[Flash]` to use Flash plugin for audio playback. However, this should be
    done on a case-by-case basis and after careful testing.
  * Nuvola SDK build system: **New dependency** for building Nuvola scripts:
    [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/) ≥ 4.3.
  * Nuvola SDK build system: If `src/webview.png` image is found, it is used to generate screenshots combining that
    **web view snapshot image** with
    [base Nuvola screenshots](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/tree/master/nuvolasdk/data/screenshots).
    The resulting images can be found in the screenshots subdirectory. More screenshot types will be added in the next
    development cycle. [[GitHub ticket](https://github.com/tiliado/nuvolasdk/issues/5)]
