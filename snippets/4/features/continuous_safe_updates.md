**Flatpak updates are safe** because they never modify files underneath a running Flatpak application,
which could make it crash and eat all your homework. Instead, the data belonging to the old applications
are kept aside untouched until the last instance exits. Taking advantage of that, Nuvola provides
**continuous updates**. When a bug is fixed, it is delivered to you as soon as possible. When a new feature
is added, you can use it right away.
