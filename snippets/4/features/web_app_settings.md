Maintainers of individual web apps can spice up their scripts with extra settings
to tweak your user experience even further. For example, music streaming apps let
you decide whether they can keep playing in the background, Amazon Music asks for
your preferred national variant, and Google Play Music may alter the behavior of
the thumb-up/down actions.
