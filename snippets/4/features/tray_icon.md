Do you remember small icons with menu actions usually shown
at the top left or top right corner? Over the years, they
become retired in some desktop environments, evolved into
app indicators, or be left untouched. Nuvola supports app
indicators (Unity, GNOME, elementaryOS), notifier items
(KDE), and legacy Xorg icons.
